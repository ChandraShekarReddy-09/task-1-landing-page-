# task-1-landing-page-
I'm happy to announce that I've finished Level-1 Task-1 of the Codsoft Internship Program! By designing a Landing Page from starting, I was able to put the basic concepts of web programming to practice. I learned how to make a visually elegant and responsive design , starting with HTML framework and closing with CSS styling.
